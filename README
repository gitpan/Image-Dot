Image::Dot v1.1
===============

This package provides 1x1 pixel PNG images of a certain RGB color
(also with transparency) without relying on any external modules like
GD, libpng or Compress::Zlib.  These pixel dots can be useful in a
pure-perl HTTP server to be able to create colored dots on-the-fly,
e.g. for formatting or drawing purposes.

Additionally, a transparent GIF dot is provided (PNG transparency
support in some common browsers is bad to non-existent).
